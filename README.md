## Getting Started

This project is implemented on Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning tasks. To interact with the code, follow the guidelines below:

### Prerequisites

- Create a Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/) account .
- Interactive code execution and exploration are possible with notebooks.


### Libraries Used

The project primarily uses the following libraries:
- `tensorflow` for building and training the deep learning model.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- *(Add any other significant libraries or dependencies here)*

### Running the Code

- Once in the Kernel, you can run the code cells sequentially using the play button or use the "Run All" option to execute all cells.
- Kaggle provides an interactive environment, so you can modify the code and view the results in real-time.


## Dataset
The project uses the CASIA-Iris-Thousand(http://biometrics.idealtest.org/). Briefly describe the dataset, its structure, and its significance.

## Model Architecture

Our iris recognition model leverages a sequential architecture tailored for feature extraction and advanced clustering. Here's  the architecture:

### Network Structure:

1. **Flatten Layer**:
   - This layer reshapes the input into a 1D vector, ensuring compatibility with the subsequent dense layers.

2. **Dense Layer (128 Neurons)**:
   - This fully connected layer consists of 128 neurons and uses the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function.
   - ReLU is applied element-wise, replacing any negative values with zeros. It introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns.

3. **Dropout Layer (40% rate)**:
   - To prevent overfitting, we've introduced a dropout layer with a rate of 0.4, which means during training, approximately 40% of neurons in the preceding layer will be turned off at each step. This helps to improve generalization by ensuring the model doesn't rely too heavily on any individual neuron.

4. **Dense Layer (64 Neurons)**:
   - Another fully connected layer with 64 neurons, also utilizing the ReLU activation function.

5. **Output Layer**:
   - The final dense layer has a number of neurons corresponding to the number of clusters (`num_clusters`).
   - It uses the softmax activation function to produce probability distributions over the `num_clusters` classes.

### Model Compilation:

- **Loss Function**: The model employs `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function, which is typically used for multi-class classification problems.
- **Optimizer**: The `adamax` optimizer is used for optimizing the model. It's a variant of the Adam optimization algorithm, specifically designed to have a more stable behavior in terms of convergence.
- **Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.

### Training:

The model is trained over 20 epochs with a batch size of 64, using both training and validation datasets to monitor and validate its performance throughout the training process.
